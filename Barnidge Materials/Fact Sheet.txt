Reuters: Uganda's social media tax will harm business, deter investment

Freedom House: Internet freedom in Uganda improved incrementally in the past year (2017, last data available), in contrast to the previous year when internet freedom saw a precipitous decline. Amendments to the Uganda Communications Bill were passed in April 2017, removing parliamentary checks and balances on the ICT minister’s supervision of the communications sector. The 2011 Computer Misuse Act was used to arrest and charge individuals with “offensive communications” for criticizing the president in two separate incidents. Civil society groups petitioned the Constitutional Court to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. Another user was arrested on terrorism charges for social media posts documenting a violent military raid.  https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2017/uganda

CIPESA (Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa): Social Media Tax Cuts Ugandan Internet Users by Five Million, Penetration Down From 47% to 35%

The tax which the Uganda government introduced on use of social media last July has slashed the number of internet users in the country by five million in three months, according to figures from the industry regulator, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC). Earlier this month, Uganda’s ICT minister Frank Tumwebaze hinted that his ministry may have been misled by the finance ministry  into supporting the tax on the assumption that it would widen the country’s revenue base. Accordingly, parliament’s committee on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ordered the ICT ministry to conduct an assessment on the impact of the social media tax and share their views with the finance ministry. According to the  2017/18 Uganda National Information Technology Survey, social media platforms are some of the popular avenues for citizens to engage with each other, and to pursue businesses and education opportunities. At least 76% of the survey respondents cited the price of internet subscription as a key limitation to their internet use. This was followed by concerns over slow internet speeds and the lack of connectivity in some areas.
